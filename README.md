## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the IDS 560 Capstone at the University of Illinois Chicago. The goal was to design an AI-powered multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate vehicle data retrieval for CCC Intelligent Solutions, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in insurance and repair industry workflows.

## 🏆 Business Problem
CCC required a data automation system that could:
✅ Automate vehicle data retrieval from multiple sources.
✅ Assist with vehicle valuation by reducing manual effort.
✅ Integrate both structured APIs and unstructured web data.
✅ Aggregate data efficiently while maintaining accuracy and relevance.

## 🔍 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Collection
📌 Sources: Web scraping & structured APIs
📌 Tools: Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium

2️⃣ Data Processing
📌 Standardization & validation using GPT & Anthropic LLMs
📌 Ensuring CCC-specific format & accuracy

3️⃣ User Interface (UI)
📌 Built using Streamlit for easy query processing
📌 Displays structured tables & lists
